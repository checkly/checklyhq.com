  2.The Parties shall comply with their respective obligations under the Privacy Laws. In particular, if Customer is established in the European Economic Area (&quot;EEA&quot;), in the United Kingdom (&quot;UK&quot;) or in California, or will, in connection with the Service, provide Checkly with personal data relating to an individual located within the EEA, the UK or California, the Parties shall comply with the Data Processing Addendum [located at https://checklyhq.com/privacy\_\_\_\_\_\_\_] which in such case is hereby incorporated into these Terms.

# **PAYMENTS; TAXES**

  1.Fees. Customer shall pay to Checkly fees as set forth in an applicable Order in accordance with the terms thereof. Any amounts arising in relation to these Terms not paid when due will be subject to a late charge of one and one-half percent (1 1/2 %) per month on the unpaid balance or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is less. In addition, if Checkly does not receive payment for fees by the due date therefor, Customer&#39;s account shall be considered past due and Checkly shall have the right to suspend the Service until payment is made, or terminate the Service with respect to the applicable Order, in accordance with these Terms. Also, in the event any payment is past due, in addition to the amount owed, Customer shall be responsible for all judicial and extrajudicial collection costs, including costs for lawyers, bailiffs and collection agencies. Without prejudice to Customer&#39;s rights set out elsewhere in these Terms, all Service fees are non-refundable and payable in advance unless otherwise set forth in the Order.

Customer will be liable for payment of such taxes. If Customer is required under applicable law to make any tax withholding from fees, payment by the Customer will be grossed up with an additional amount to cover such withholding as may be necessary in order to ensure that the net amount received by Checkly is equal to the total amount that Checkly would have received if such withholding had not been applied.

Each party represents and warrants that: (a) it has full power and authority to enter into these Terms and to perform its obligations hereunder; (b) these Terms are legally binding upon it and enforceable in accordance with its terms; and (c) the execution, delivery and performance of these Terms does not and will not conflict with any agreement, instrument, judgment or understanding to which it is a party or by which it may be bound.

These Terms may be terminated by either party immediately upon written notice to the other party if: the other party: (a) becomes insolvent, (b) voluntarily commences any proceeding or files any petition under applicable bankruptcy laws, (c) becomes subject to any involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings under applicable laws, which proceedings are not dismissed within thirty (30) days, (d) makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or (e) appoints a receiver, trustee, custodian or liquidator for a substantial portion of its property, assets or business.

Following termination of the Service, Checkly may immediately deactivate Customer&#39;s account. Any accrued rights and obligations will survive termination.

# **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  1. Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior negotiations or agreements (oral or written), between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof. When used in these Terms, the term &quot;including&quot; or &quot;includes&quot; means &quot;including but not limited to&quot;.
  
  2. Publicity. Customer hereby consents to inclusion of its name and logo in client lists and marketing materials that may be published as part of Checkly&#39;s marketing and promotional efforts.
  
  3. Modification. Checkly may make changes to these Terms of Use from time to time. If Checkly makes a material change to these Terms, Checkly will inform Customer by e-mail to the e-mail address(es) noted on the Order (or subsequently designated by Customer in writing as a contact for notifications from Checkly), or through a banner or other prominent notice within the Service, or through the Checkly support platform. If Customer does not agree to the change, Customer must so notify Checkly by [e-mail to legal@checklyhq.com] within thirty (30) days after Checkly&#39;s notice. If Customer so notifies Checkly, then Customer will remain governed by the most recent Terms of Use applicable to Customer until the end of the then-current period of the Subscription Term and the updated terms shall apply upon the commencement of the subsequent period of the Subscription Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Checkly is required to change these Terms in order to remain compliant with applicable law, and Customer does not agree to such change, Checkly may terminate the Customer&#39;s Order, in which case Checkly shall provide Customer with a pro-rated refund of any pre-paid fees for Service not performed by the effective date of termination.
  
  4. Severability. If any provision of these Terms is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
  
  5. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to these Terms will be the courts located in New York, New York, and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any such actions. To the extent not prohibited by law, each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms.
  
  6. Remedies. Except as specifically provided otherwise herein, each right and remedy in these Terms is in addition to any other right or remedy, at law or in equity. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of a party&#39;s confidentiality obligations or proprietary rights hereunder, the non-breaching party may suffer irreparable damage for which it will have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain such breach or threatened breach, without the necessity of posting any bond.
  
  7. Notices. All notices under these Terms will be in writing and delivered to the parties at: in the case of Checkly, its address as stated in the first paragraph hereof and, in the case of Customer, its address as set forth on the Order, or at such other address designated by a party to the other by written notice. Notices will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by email or facsimile; the day after being sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service; or upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
  
  8. Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned, in whole or in part, by Customer without Checkly&#39;s written consent. Checkly may freely assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, or may delegate or subcontract to third parties any of its duties and obligations hereunder, without the need for the consent of Customer. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors, representatives and permitted assigns of the parties hereto.
