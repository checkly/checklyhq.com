Single Sign-On (SSO) enables businesses to secure employee access across a variety of third-party services. Currently, Checkly supports the following SSO protocols:

1. SAML
2. Microsoft Azure AD

If you are interested in using Checkly with a different SSO protocol, please [reach out to support](mailto:support@checklyhq.com).

> SSO is only available for Checkly's paid plans.
