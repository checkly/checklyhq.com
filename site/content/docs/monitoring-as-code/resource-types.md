## Development version

If you want to get your hands dirty in the bleeding edge version, you can:

1. Check out the Checkly Terraform provider in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/checkly/terraform-provider-checkly).
2. Build the provider and add it to your Terraform installation.
3. Write your first Checkly resource and apply it.
