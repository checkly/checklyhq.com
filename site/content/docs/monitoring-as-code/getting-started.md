The Checkly Terraform provider enables you to declare your monitoring setup as code using [HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). You can get started with it in a matter of minutes by following the steps shown below.

{{<info>}}
For in-depth information on Terraform, please see HashiCorp's [official documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/checkly/checkly/latest/docs).
{{</info>}}

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the [latest version](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) of Terraform.

Next, switch to a new folder for your project, and create your `main.tf` file:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    checkly = {
      source = "checkly/checkly"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

variable "checkly_api_key" {}
variable "checkly_account_id" {}

provider "checkly" {
  api_key = var.checkly_api_key
  account_id = var.checkly_account_id
}
```

To use the provider with your Checkly account, you will need an API Key for your Checkly user. Go to the [API keys tab](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/api-keys) in your user settings and click `Create API key`. Get your User API key and add it to your env:

```bash
$ export TF_VAR_checkly_api_key=cu_xxx
```

You also need to set your target account ID, which you can find under your [account settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/general). If you don't have access to account settings, please contact your account owner/admin.

```bash
$ export TF_VAR_checkly_account_id=xxx
```

{{<info>}}
If you do not export these environment variables, Terraform will ask you to enter them later.
{{</info>}}

Running `terraform init` will install the Checkly Terraform provider for you, as well as initialising your project. You can now start adding resources to your file. You can check the official documentation to see [available parameters](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/checkly/checkly/latest/docs/resources/check) for each resource type. As an example, you could add a basic browser check resource at the bottom of your `main.tf`:

```terraform
resource "checkly_check" "browser-check-1" {
  name                      = "Example check"
  type                      = "BROWSER"
  activated                 = true
  frequency                 = 5
  double_check              = true
  locations = [
    "eu-central-1",
    "us-west-1"
  ]

  script = <<EOT
const assert = require("chai").assert;
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto("https://google.com/");
const title = await page.title();

assert.equal(title, "Google");
await browser.close();

EOT
}
```

## Applying changes

After each change to your Terraform file, you will need to run the following two commands:
1. `terraform plan -out tf.plan` - to plan the necessary actions that Terraform will need to make.
2. `terraform apply "tf.plan"` - to apply the plan and have the changes reflected on Checkly.

If you are using [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/cloud), the above will be run for you automatically every time a pull request is merged into the main branch.

{{<warning>}}
Checkly resources should be managed _either_ through Terraform _or_ through the Checkly UI, not both.
Modifying Terraform-managed resources via the UI, and viceversa, is likely to cause issues.
