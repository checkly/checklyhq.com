There are cases in which you might have to whitelist Checkly traffic in your firewall or load balancer to prevent it from being blocked or to prevent it from skewing analytics data. Below are some of solutions you can look into to achieve that.

## IP range whitelisting

Whitelisting Checkly traffic by IP address or range is not possible at this moment as Checkly uses a non-static set of IP addresses in the cloud to run its checks.

You can however fetch a list of the [dynamic IP addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html) in use at AWS, our cloud provider.

{{<warning>}}
Since the AWS IP ranges are quite vast, we suggest trying one of the methods below instead.

## Header/user agent whitelisting

If you are using Cloudflare or a similar provider, one or more of your automated checks might trigger a [bot detection mechanism](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-bot-traffic/). 

If you want to prevent that from happening without exposing your website to any and all automated traffic, you might want to set up a new [firewall rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/) allowing traffic from Checkly as long as it contains a specific header or sets a certain user agent.

You can make the header and/or user agent specific to your own Checkly user account by grabbing the first eight digits of your unique user ID (or another fixed value of your choice), which you can find below your account name on the [Account Settings page](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/). Embedding this value in your checks will enable them to be allowed through by your firewall rules.

### Whitelisting API checks using headers

To whitelist API checks, allow traffic that contains a cookie in the shape of `Cookie: "checkly-account:<UUID>"`, with `<UUID>` being your shortened Checkly ID or other chosen value. 

You can then [set the Cookie header](https://checklyhq.com/docs/api-checks/request-settings/#headers) while editing your check.

You can set the header at group-level using [API check defaults](/docs/groups/api-check-defaults/#headers--query-parameters) to have it applied to every check in the group.

### Whitelisting browser checks with user agents

To whitelist browser checks, allow traffic with user agent containing `Checkly/<UUID>`, with `<UUID>` being your shortened Checkly ID or another chosen value. 

You will then be able to set up the matching user agent in your browser checks using Playwright's [`userAgent`](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation#user-agent) context property or Puppeteer's [setUserAgent method](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&show=api-pagesetuseragentuseragent-useragentmetadata).

{{< tabs "User agent example" >}}
{{< tab "Playwright" >}}
```js
const playwright = require('playwright')
const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch()
const myUserAgent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.108 Safari/537.36 Checkly/abcd1234'
const context = await browser.newContext({
  userAgent: myUserAgent
});

const page = await context.newPage()
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Puppeteer" >}}
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer')
const browser = await puppeteer.launch()
const userAgent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.108 Safari/537.36 Checkly/abcd1234'
const page = await browser.newPage()

await page.setUserAgent(userAgent);
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

## Filtering Google Analytics

If you want to filter Checkly traffic in Google Analytics because Checkly browser checks are skewing your 
numbers, here is one way how to do it:

1. Add a UTM source tag to the URL's your requesting, i.e.

{{< tabs "Goto example" >}}
{{< tab "Puppeteer" >}}
```js
await page.goto('https://app.checklyhq.com/login?utm_source=monitoring')
 ```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Playwright" >}}
```js
await page.goto('https://app.checklyhq.com/login?utm_source=monitoring')
 ```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

2. In Google Analytics, filter on campaign source.

For detailed instructions, see [the Google Analytics docs on custom filters](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033162#CustomFilters).

 > Note, it will take some hours for this to take effect.

## Default Checkly user agent

This is what Checkly sends as user agent:

- API checks: `Checkly/1.0 (https://www.checklyhq.com)`.
- Browser checks: `Checkly, https://www.checklyhq.com`.

Changing the user agent of a check will not change the browser or browser version, it will simply set a new string for user-agent.
