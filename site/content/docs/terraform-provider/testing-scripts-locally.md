## Enabling local script execution

Having the possibility to develop Playwright scripts for your browser checks locally will allow you to move faster and with more confidence. You can easily achieve this by storing your scripts in local folders and passing the path to the right script:

```terraform
resource "checkly_check" "e2e-checkout" {
  name                      = "Checkout Flow"
  type                      = "BROWSER"
  activated                 = true
  should_fail               = false
  frequency                 = 1
  double_check              = true
  ssl_check                 = false
  use_global_alert_settings = true
  locations = [
    "us-west-1",
    "eu-central-1"
  ]

  script = file("${path.module}/scripts/checkout.js") // Our script is contained in this file
}
```

In order to have the script work both locally and on Checkly without changes, make sure your script is wrapped in a function:

```javascript
async function run () {
  const browser = await chromium.launch()
  const page = await browser.newPage()

  const response = await page.goto('https://danube-web.shop')

  // ...
  
  await page.close()
  await browser.close()
}

run()
```

If your script is taking advantage of Checkly's code snippets, you can keep your setup nice and tidy and just `require` your snippets right in your script:

```javascript
require('./snippets/login'); // This gives you access to your snippet locally and on Checkly

async function run () {
  const browser = await chromium.launch()
  const page = await browser.newPage()

  const response = await page.goto('https://danube-web.shop')

  performLogin(page) // You can invoke functions from your snippet

  // ...
  
  await page.close()
  await browser.close()
}

run()
```

You can point to the same file you use for your snippet when creating your snippet resource:

```terraform
resource "checkly_snippet" "procedure-login" {
  name   = "Login"
  script = file("${path.module}/snippets/login.js") // Your script is contained in this file
}
```

The `./snippets/` path is where Checkly will make your snippets available. Use this directory in your Terraform setup to keep things consistent.
