**Checkly private locations is a technical preview feature. It is not recommended for production use and is available on request.**

Note: While scheduled check runs work as expected, you cannot currently test checks from private locations. We are working on adding this soon. When saving an API check using the "Run & save" button, the test check will fail and you will need to click "Save this check anyway" to continue.

Note: The Checkly Agent currently only supports x86/AMD64 architecture and not ARM64. This means Apple Mac M1 systems are not currently supported.

## About Private Locations

**You must have the Owner or Admin role on your Checkly account to create private locations.**

Here are the requirements/questions before you get started:

- Container runtime (we test using Docker, but other OCI-compliant runtimes should work)
- Outbound internet access to https://agent.checklyhq.com (proxy configuration is supported)
- Access to your internal API- or browser-based application
- A Checkly account that you will use for testing Private Locations

Here's how private locations work:

A private location is similar to our existing public locations, but you have control over it. A private location can be in your own segregated network,  on-premises or cloud-based. You need one or more Checkly Agents installed in that location/network with access to your applications. Checkly checks are configured and scheduled in the Checkly cloud-based web UI as usual, but selecting a private location runs the check on the agent(s) in your infrastructure. Agents are stateless and ephemeral. As long as you have at least one operational agent, checks will run in your private location. Adding more agents will distribute the load and improve resilience automatically.

## Configuring a Private Location:

1) Log in to your Checkly account.

2) Navigate to the Private Locations settings page.

3) Click the New Private Location button.

4) Provide a name and icon for the new private location. The ID is automatically generated ID for API access.

![new private location](/docs/images/private-locations/new_private_location.png)

5) Click Create.

6) You will receive an API key for the new location. Copy this key and keep it safe as you will need it to add agents to the location, and you wonâ€™t be able to see it again.

7) You now see your new private location in the list with no agents installed. Copy the docker run command as shown.

8) Paste the `docker run` command into your container host. Paste your API key from step 6 between the quotation marks for the `API_KEY` environment variable. Optionally, replace `docker` with the command for your container engine of choice (podman, etc.).

9) Optional: You can configure an HTTP proxy if one is required for your environment. Add an additional environment variable after the `API_KEY` like this:

`-e HTTP_PROXY="https://user:password@127.0.0.1:8080"`

10) Run the complete `docker run` command to start the agent.

11) Once the agent container is downloaded and starts up, you can see it in a running state using the appropriate command from your container engine (typically `docker ps`).

```
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                         COMMAND        CREATED        STATUS            PORTS   NAMES
5c8753a42d05  [ghcr.io/checkly/agent:latest](http://ghcr.io/checkly/agent:latest)  node index.js  2 minutes ago  Up 2 minutes ago          confident_leakey
```

12) You can also check the logs of the new container to ensure it's up and running (typically `docker logs <container_name>`).

```
[checkly-agent] Starting Consumer c7495186-6f1e-4526-b173-14ee9ad21775
[checkly-agent] No jobs. Waiting..
[checkly-agent] No jobs. Waiting..
[checkly-agent] No jobs. Waiting..
[checkly-agent] No jobs. Waiting..
[checkly-agent] No jobs. Waiting..
```

13) Start additional agents as required. A single agent is fine for testing but multiple agent containers are recommended for redundancy.

14) Refresh the private locations page in the Checkly app and you will see a count of the number of running agents.

15) Create a new API or Browser check as you normally would in Checkly. You will now see your new private location in the list of available locations. Select it and deselect any other locations.

![select private location](/docs/images/private-locations/select_private_location.png)

16) Finish configuring your check and save it.

17) You can now see the results in the check results page.
