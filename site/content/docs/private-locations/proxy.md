If you are operating our [Checkly Agent](/docs/private-locations/private-locations-getting-started/) behind an HTTP proxy, for example in an enterprise environment, you can use the `proxy` option when instantiating Playwright in your browser checks.

For example, at the start of a Playwright-based browser check, you can pass an options object with the proxy configuration. For puppeteer, the setup is slightly different, please check that tab for an example.


{{< tabs "Proxy Settings" >}}
  {{< tab "Playwright" >}}
```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright')

async function run () {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({
    proxy: {
      server: 'http://proxy.server:8080',
      username: 'usr',
      password: 'pwd'
    }
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage()
  await page.goto('https://google.com')
}

run()
```
  {{< /tab >}}   
  {{< tab "Puppeteer" >}}
```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: ['--proxy-server=proxy.server:8080']
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://google.com');
  await browser.close();
})();
```
  {{< /tab >}}   
{{< /tabs >}}   

This is all that is required for a browser check to proxy all outbound network connections via your designated HTTP proxy. For more information, please check out the [Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/network#http-proxy) and the Chromium [Network Settings docs](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-settings/).
