If you are operating our [Checkly Agent](/docs/private-locations/private-locations-getting-started/) behind an HTTP proxy, 
for example in an enterprise environment, you can use an outgoing proxy for all check traffic. We recommend using the following
setup.

> Note you can also define a proxy for management traffic from your private location to the Checkly API where we ingest
> your telemetry and management events. See [the environment variables available to the Checkly Agent container](/docs/private-locations/checkly-agent-guide/#checkly-agent-environment-variables)

## Setting an HTTP proxy for your Private Location

We recommend storing the URL of your proxy in a [global environment variable](https://app.checklyhq.com/environment-variables)
so you can easily reuse it in your Private Location configuration and checks. In the example below we store it as `PROXY_URL`

![private location proxy url](/docs/images/private-locations/private_location_proxy_url.png)

After this, you can reference this variable using `{{PROXY_URL}}` in the Private Location configuration.

![private location proxy url](/docs/images/private-locations/private_locations_proxy_config.png)

## Using an HTTP proxy with API checks

With the setup complete, any API check which uses that Private Location will automatically inherit the proxy configuration
for outgoing traffic.

## Using an HTTP proxy with Browser checks

You can enable your proxy directly in your browser checks via a few extra lines of code, using the `process.env.PROXY_URL` 
notation. For Playwright, you can use the `proxy` option when launching a new browser instance. With Puppeteer, you can pass
the URL as a CLI option, but you will have to supply the username and password separately if your proxy is authenticated.

{{< tabs "Proxy Settings" >}}
  {{< tab "Playwright" >}}
```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright')

;(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({
    proxy: {
      server: process.env.PROXY_URL // just reference the global evironment variable.
    }
  })
  const page = await browser.newPage()
  await page.goto('https://google.com')
  await page.close()
  await browser.close()
})()
```
  {{< /tab >}}   
  {{< tab "Puppeteer" >}}
```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer')

;(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: ['--proxy-server=123.456.789:3128'] // provide the host and port name here
  })
  const page = await browser.newPage()
  await page.authenticate({ // provide any authentication credentials here
    username: 'username',
    password: 'password',
  })
})()
```

This is all that is required for a browser check to proxy all outbound network connections via your designated HTTP proxy.
