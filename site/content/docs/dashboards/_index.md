Checkly dashboards are public dashboards available on every plan. Use them on your wall mounted TVs, on
shared monitors around the office or as a status page on your site.

> Dashboards can be **embedded in iframes**.

You can create multiple, distinct dashboards based on your plan. Edit your dashboard by clicking on
the **Dashboards** button on the Checkly default dashboard page.

An example of a dashboard is [status.checklyhq.com](https://status.checklyhq.com) as shown in the screenshot below.

## Adding checks to your dashboard

In order to show specific checks in a dashboard, you will need to do this:

1. First add tags to one or more checks you would like to show. This is done by editing the check(s). 

![Tags](/docs/images/dashboards/tags.png)

Don't forget to press Enter to save the tag before you save your updated check!

2. Then, edit the dashboard to include the tag:

![Filter by tags](/docs/images/dashboards/filter_by_tag.png)

Also in this step, please remember to hit Enter to save the tag before you hit "Save settings".

All the checks you include this way will show up on your dashboard.
