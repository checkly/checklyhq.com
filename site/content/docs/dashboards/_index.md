Checkly dashboards are public dashboards available on every plan. Use them on your wall mounted TVs, on
shared monitors around the office or as a status page on your site.

An example of a dashboard is [status.checklyhq.com](https://status.checklyhq.com).

> Dashboards can be **embedded in iframes**.

You can create multiple, distinct dashboards based on your plan. Edit your dashboard by clicking on
the **Dashboards** button on the Checkly default dashboard page.
