Dashboards have a lot of tweakable options to make them work for you in your situation.

- **logo:** Display any image on the top left side of your dashboard.
- **header:** Add a clarifying text like a team or environment name. This is separate from your custom URL or domain.
- **tags:** Specify the tags of the checks you want to show on the dashboard. By default we show all checks. You can also choose to hide the tags from the dashboard.
- **screen width:** Some screens are bigger than others, pick whether we should center the content or use the whole width.
- **refresh rate:** Choose how often we should poll for new results and statuses.
- **pagination:** Depending on your screen height and amount of checks, we can paginate through them so you have a full overview
without sacrificing legibility per check.
